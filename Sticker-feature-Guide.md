ðŸ’«Sticker command is now updated. You can use
sticker --number to get sticker in different qualities.
*note* : number must be *between 1-100* else it'll be set to default 50 value.

Use case : If normal &sticker command doesn't work because the gif is too big. You can try &sticker with lower quality. like &sticker --1
or vice versa.

Example command : 
&sticker --1
&sticker --crop --1
&sticker --c --50
&sticker --s --40

note that here --c crops the sticker into square
and --s stretches it.

Also,

&sticker --love --crop --70
&sticker --happy --40

here --love --happy organizes the sticker into the Whatsapp's inbuilt emoji pack
( as per the photo )
